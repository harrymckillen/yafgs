## Introduction

### What is it?

Like any grid system you've seen previously. I make no promises this will change your life, rock your world or any other such nonsense. It's just a very straightforward and frank grid system. It works the way it works. Might not be everyone's cup of tea.

The idea of it is that it provides a number of different options to hopefully fit a wide variety of needs. It's essentially a mixed grid system, where I've cobbled together a few different ideas I've gotten from other grid systems I've used and put them into one single grid system.

There are 3 main grid widths:

* Large - 1140px max width
* Medium - 960px max width
* Small - 800px max width

#### Version 1.x

Relies on the old method of floats, clear, percentages.

#### Version 2.x

Introduces CSS Flexbox. Currently has very basic support for it. As I learn about Flexbox, and browser support improves, I will develop this version further.
